# ProgramLauncher

## Description
Simple first time attempt at a Python GUI using Tkinker. Similar to the ability to set apps to start on system boot in Windows 10, this python program allows you to save a group of programs and run them with one simple click! Avoid the hassle of tirelessly searching for each individual app.

## Usage and Purpose 
This is a modified version of the program designed in a youtube tutorial by Dev Ed which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE-SpRI3K5g) and includes some additional features I felt would improve the user experience. Main goal was to save and record the process of my first time learning Tkinker for future use. To run the program just download the python program and run it directly.
